## Trigger Word Detection
In this article, they learned about applying deep learning to speech recognition before. So in this assignment, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for tigger word detection. Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices to wake up upon hearing a certain word.

For this exercise, out trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."

In this assignment you will learn to:
- Structure a speech recognition project.
- Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
- Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
